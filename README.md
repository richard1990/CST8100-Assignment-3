# CST8110 Assignment #3 - Loops and Classes
This was the third assignment I created in my "Intro to Computer Programming" course at Algonquin College. Written in Java, the program is a simple guessing game where a number between 1 and 1000 is randomly chosen and the player has to guess the number. After each guess the player is told if they were too high or too low, and once they guess the correct number the number of guesses is displayed and they are asked if they want to play again.

This assignment built on my knowledge of loops, conditional statements, logical thinking, and classes as the GamePlay class simply launches the program while the GuessGame class holds all the data and methods to properly run the program.
